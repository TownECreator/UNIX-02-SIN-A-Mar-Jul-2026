git checkout branch name #is used to switch to another branch in your Git repository.
#An absolute route (or absolute path) is the full path to a file or directory starting from the root of the file system, no matter where you currently are.
#A relative path (or relative route) is a path that is defined based on your current location (current directory), not from the root.
mkdir proyecto # Creates a new directory (folder) named "proyecto"
ls # Lists the files and directories in the current folder
cd proyecto/ # Moves into the "proyecto" directory
cd .. # Goes up one level to the parent directory
cd /workspaces/UNIX-02-SIN-A-Mar-Jul-2026/proyecto # Moves to this directory using an absolute path (from the root)
cd #change directory to home directory
pwd # Prints the current working directory (shows where you are)
cd / # Changes directory to the root folder (/) 
#it does not matter what directory you are in, if u put cd it will move you into that
cd /workspaces/   # Changes directory to the /workspaces folder using an absolute path
# this ~ identifies the home directory
cd /workspaces/UNIX-02-SIN-A-Mar-Jul-2026/   # Changes directory to this specific project folder using an absolute path
cd /home/codespace/   # Changes directory to the codespace user's home directory using an absolute path
#Environment variables are values stored in the operating system that programs can use to configure their behavior.
#the most basic thing you can do is write something in one archive and make another one read it
echo $HOME   # Prints the user's home directory path (environment variable)
echo $BASH   # Prints the path to the Bash shell executable
echo $PATH   # Prints the list of directories where the system looks for executable commands
cd /usr/local   # Changes directory to /usr/local, a system folder where locally installed software is stored
ls -lai  or ls -l -a -i # Lists all files (including hidden ones) in long format, shows inode numbers, and displays detailed info like permissions, owner, size, and modification date
man ls   # Opens the manual page for the "ls" command, showing detailed documentation, options, and usage examples
ls --all   # Lists all files in the directory, including hidden files (those starting with .) these directories are hard links
cd /workspaces   # Changes directory to the /workspaces folder
cd /bin          # Changes directory to /bin, which contains essential system binaries (commands)
ls -a            # Lists all files, including hidden files (starting with .)
ls -all          # Same idea as detailed listing; in most systems this is equivalent to "ls -l -a" or may not be valid as a separate option (correct form is usually "ls -la")
# . means actual directory, while .. represents the parent directory
